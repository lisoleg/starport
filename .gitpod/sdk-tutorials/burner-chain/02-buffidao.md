# Peggy/Scavenge + BuffiDao

The purpose of the chain is to extend the Scavenger hunt game in order to interact with the Eth Denver [BuffiDao](https://buffidao.com) game. Cosmos has **1200 XP** to give out and **2 NFT badges** (Big Brain and Cosmic Brain). We have locked all of them up within a peggy bridge contract deployed to the xDai chain. This contract is controlled by the validators of our Burner Chain which relay transactions between the two chains. In order to claim `XP` on the Cosmos Burner Chain you must first have signed up for our survey. You should have done that already if you are here, but if not head over [here](https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/lDB3Xp). Afterwards you can claim your `XP` on the Cosmos burner chain where you will be able to move the `XP` back to the BuffiDai contract on xDai using the Peggy ETH bridge.

To win MORE `XP` as well as the **Bronze** and **Silver** Badge NFTs you must play the Scavenge game! This is a series of riddles and scavenger hunts which result in secret answers that are submitted via commit-reveal to the Cosmos Chain. Correct results are rewarded with `XP` as well as a burner chain native token called `brain`. The top two owners of `brain` at the end of the hackathon will win the two NFT Badges--Big Brain & Cosmos Brain.
